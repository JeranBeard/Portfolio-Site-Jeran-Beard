        <h1>Hi I'm Jeran</h1>
        <h2> UI designer based in South Africa</h2>
        <p>Im a I.T Technician based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
            I have a background in International hospitality and events management, customer service, graphic and web
            design, digital marketing and UI design. I have been working in I.T for the past 1 year now.
            Combining my background I am equipped with various skills such as interviewing, conducting research,
            collaborating problem solving and creating content with keeping users in mind.
            I love to design and create content. I like solving problems and finding a way to help others. I am yearning
            to take my ideas
            as well as others and turn them into something visually appealing that everyone can benefit from.</p>
