        This is the home page where you

        The idea around this page was to provide a medical aid card for the animal. It has all the relevant information
        needed and this helps frustration trying to remember everything. Along with near by vets if you are in need of
        one.</p>

      <p>
        Some animals have strict diets that they need to stick to or maybe their owner only prefers them eating a
        certain type of food.
        In the diet section you have the option to buy and see recipes to make doggo treats and for those who are on a
        more strict eating plan have lots of choices for an alternative meal.</p>

        Track me is one of my favourite features, Not only does it help to find the nearest restaurant or dog park but
        you can actually connect a tracker on your dog so when they decide to go on adventure you have the ability to
        track them and see how far or where they are going.</p>
